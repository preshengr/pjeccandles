## Extra Tools I Used  

### **SCSS**  
SCSS (Sassy CSS) was used to enhance the styling process. It allowed for the use of variables, mixins, and nested rules, making the CSS code more modular, maintainable, and easier to manage. This significantly improved the efficiency of styling the website and ensured a consistent design across all pages.  

### **Hack**  
Hack, a programming language for the HipHop Virtual Machine (HHVM), was integrated to add type safety and modern programming features to the PHP codebase. This improved code reliability and performance, making the application more robust and scalable.  

### **PHP**  
PHP served as the backbone of the project, handling server-side logic and database interactions. Its flexibility and ease of integration with MySQL made it ideal for building the eCommerce platform. PHP also enabled dynamic content rendering and seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
